<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About Gordon Setters</h1>

<p>Gordon Setters generate many questions from prospective owners, hunters, and dog enthusiasts curious about this distinctive Scottish breed. These black and tan setters combine hunting prowess with family companionship, but they're not the right fit for every household. Understanding the breed's specific needs, characteristics, and quirks helps determine whether a Gordon Setter aligns with your lifestyle and expectations.</p>

<p>The following questions address the most common concerns and curiosities about Gordon Setters, from basic breed information to specific training challenges and comparisons with other setter breeds. These answers draw from breed standards, veterinary research, and the collective experience of Gordon Setter owners and breeders.</p>

<details>
<summary>What is a Gordon Setter?</summary>
<p>A Gordon Setter is a large sporting dog breed originally developed in Scotland for hunting game birds. They are known for their black and tan coat, gentle temperament, and excellent pointing and retrieving abilities. The breed was refined at Gordon Castle by the 4th Duke of Gordon during the late 1700s and early 1800s, making it Scotland's only native gundog breed. Gordon Setters excel at methodically working upland terrain to locate, point, and retrieve game birds including grouse, pheasant, and quail. They possess a substantial build compared to other setters, with males weighing 55-80 pounds and females 45-70 pounds. Their distinctive coloring - solid black with rich tan markings above the eyes, on the muzzle, throat, chest, legs, and under the tail - makes them instantly recognizable. The breed serves dual purposes today, functioning as both capable hunting companions and devoted family dogs for active households.</p>

<summary>How big do Gordon Setters get?</summary>
<p>Gordon Setters typically weigh between 45-80 pounds and stand 23-27 inches tall at the shoulder, with males being generally larger than females in this breed. Specifically, male Gordon Setters usually measure 24-27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 55-80 pounds when in proper working condition. Females typically stand 23-26 inches tall and weigh 45-70 pounds. These measurements make Gordon Setters the heaviest and most substantial of the three setter breeds. Their size reflects their original purpose working in rugged Scottish terrain where power and stamina mattered more than speed. Puppies grow rapidly during their first year, reaching near-adult height by 9-12 months but continuing to fill out and develop muscle mass until 18-24 months of age. Prospective owners should prepare for a large, athletic dog that requires significant space, substantial food quantities (typically 3-4 cups of quality dog food daily for adults), and the physical strength to handle a powerful sporting breed on leash.</p>

<details>
<summary>Are Gordon Setters good family dogs?</summary>
<p>Yes, Gordon Setters make excellent family dogs as they are loyal, gentle with children, and have a calm disposition indoors, though they do require regular exercise and mental stimulation due to their sporting dog heritage. Their devotion to their family is legendary - Gordons form deep bonds and prefer being involved in household activities rather than isolated in a yard. They typically show patience with children, especially when raised with them from puppyhood, though their size means supervision is necessary with toddlers who might be accidentally knocked over. However, Gordon Setters are not ideal for every family situation. They need active owners who can provide 90-120 minutes of daily vigorous exercise. Families with sedentary lifestyles or those away from home for long periods will find a Gordon Setter develops behavioral problems including destructiveness, excessive barking, and anxiety. They also shed moderately year-round and heavily during seasonal coat changes, requiring regular grooming. First-time dog owners may find their independent thinking and training challenges frustrating. The ideal Gordon Setter family enjoys outdoor activities, has a securely fenced yard, and appreciates a dog that's both an athletic companion and a gentle house dog.</p>
</details>
</div>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>How much exercise does a Gordon Setter need?</summary>
<p>Gordon Setters need at least 1-2 hours (90-120 minutes) of daily exercise including walks, runs, or active play. They thrive with activities that engage their natural hunting instincts like hiking or field work. This isn't a breed satisfied with a leisurely stroll around the block - Gordons require vigorous exercise that elevates their heart rate and engages their mind. Ideal activities include off-leash running in safely enclosed areas, hiking on varied terrain, swimming, retrieving games, and participation in dog sports like field trials, hunt tests, agility, or rally obedience. Many Gordon owners split exercise into two or three sessions daily: a morning run or training session, midday mental stimulation through puzzle toys or scent work, and an evening walk or play session. Without adequate exercise, Gordon Setters become frustrated, destructive, and difficult to live with. They may dig, bark excessively, chew furniture, or develop compulsive behaviors. Young Gordons (under 2 years) often have even higher exercise needs, though strenuous exercise should be moderated during rapid growth phases to protect developing joints. Older Gordons still require regular exercise but may settle for slightly less intense activities as they age beyond 7-8 years.</p>

<details>
<summary>How do you train a Gordon Setter?</summary>
<p>Training a Gordon Setter requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement methods that respect their intelligent but independent nature. These dogs think for themselves - a trait bred into them for making decisions while hunting far from their handler - which means they won't blindly follow commands like some more biddable breeds. Start training early, ideally beginning socialization and basic obedience at 8 weeks old. Use reward-based methods with high-value treats, praise, and play rather than harsh corrections which can make Gordons stubborn or shut down entirely. Keep training sessions short (10-15 minutes) and varied to maintain their interest, as they bore easily with repetitive drills. Focus on building a strong recall since their hunting instincts can override obedience when they catch an interesting scent. Professional training assistance is often beneficial, particularly for first-time Gordon owners. Puppy kindergarten classes provide essential socialization, while advanced obedience or field training helps channel their energy appropriately. Expect training to progress more slowly than with breeds like Golden Retrievers or Labrador Retrievers - Gordons mature slowly both physically and mentally, often not reaching full mental maturity until 2-3 years old. Consistency across all family members is essential, as Gordons will exploit inconsistencies in household rules.</p>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between a Gordon Setter and an Irish Setter?</summary>
<p>The differences between Gordon Setters and Irish Setters extend beyond their obvious coat color distinction - Gordons are black and tan while Irish Setters are solid mahogany red. Gordon Setters are more substantial dogs, weighing 55-80 pounds with heavier bone structure compared to the more refined, racy Irish Setter at 60-70 pounds. Temperamentally, Gordons tend to be more serious, methodical, and slightly reserved with strangers, while Irish Setters are famously exuberant, outgoing, and sometimes described as 'clownish' in their enthusiasm. In hunting scenarios, these personality differences translate to distinct working styles: Gordon Setters work at a moderate pace, staying relatively close to their handler and thoroughly covering every bit of ground, making them excellent for thick cover and difficult terrain. Irish Setters range wider and faster, covering more ground with their elegant gait, which suits open country and field trial competition. Training difficulty differs as well - both breeds can be independent thinkers, but Irish Setters generally respond more enthusiastically to training, while Gordons require more experienced handling. For families, Irish Setters maintain their puppy-like exuberance longer (sometimes seeming to never fully mature), while Gordons settle into calmer house dogs once properly exercised, though both breeds need active homes.</p>

<details>
<summary>Where can I find a reputable Gordon Setter breeder?</summary>
<p>Finding a reputable Gordon Setter breeder requires research and patience since this relatively rare breed has only about 200-300 puppies registered annually with the AKC across the entire United States. Start with the Gordon Setter Club of America's breeder referral program, which lists breeders who agree to follow the club's code of ethics. Reputable breeders conduct comprehensive health testing on their breeding stock including OFA hip and elbow evaluations, thyroid panels, and annual eye examinations through CERF. They'll provide documentation of these clearances and typically offer health guarantees. Expect to be interviewed extensively - good breeders want to ensure their puppies go to appropriate homes and will ask about your experience with dogs, living situation, activity level, and what you want in a Gordon Setter. They'll also allow you to meet at least the mother (and ideally the father) and see where puppies are raised. Red flags include breeders with multiple litters available simultaneously, those who won't let you visit their facility, lack of health testing documentation, or willingness to sell puppies before 8 weeks of age. Be prepared to wait - many reputable breeders have waiting lists of 6-12 months or longer. Gordon Setter puppies from health-tested parents typically cost $1,200-$2,500. Regional breed clubs can also provide breeder referrals, and attending dog shows or field trials where Gordon Setters compete allows you to meet breeders and see their dogs in action.</p>

<details>
<summary>Do Gordon Setters shed a lot?</summary>
<p>Gordon Setters shed moderately throughout the year with heavier seasonal shedding periods during spring and fall when they 'blow' their coat. Their medium to long, straight or slightly wavy coat requires regular maintenance to manage shedding and prevent matting. Expect to find black and tan hair on furniture, clothing, and floors despite regular grooming. The breed's feathering on the chest, legs, belly, and tail tends to collect debris from outdoor activities and requires particular attention. To minimize shedding and maintain coat health, Gordon Setters need brushing 2-3 times weekly during normal periods, increasing to daily during heavy shedding seasons. Use a pin brush or slicker brush for the body coat and a metal comb for feathering. Regular bathing every 6-8 weeks helps remove loose hair, though too-frequent bathing can dry the skin and worsen shedding. Professional grooming every 8-12 weeks helps keep the coat manageable, with groomers typically trimming excess feathering, tidying ears and feet, and thinning the coat if needed. Unlike some breeds, Gordon Setters are not hypoallergenic, and their shedding makes them unsuitable for people with significant dog allergies. The Gordon Setter poodle mix (Gordondoodle) was developed partly to address shedding concerns, though first-generation crosses produce unpredictable coat types and shedding levels.</p>
